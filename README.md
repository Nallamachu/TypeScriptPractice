# TypeScriptPractice
Prior to start learning Type script, you should have installed ```NPM, NodeJS``` along with an IDE like ```VS Code```.

## Execution Steps
<ul>
<li>tsc followed by the .ts file to compile the Type Script code and generate the .js code. For example, tsc sample.ts</li>
<li>node followed by .js file to show the output of the converted java script code. For example, node sample.js</li>
</ul>
